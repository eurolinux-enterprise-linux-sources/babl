	out if it wasn't included beforehand.

2009-02-20  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h: Include headers in babl.h as system headers

2009-01-26  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* babl/babl.h
	* babl/babl-format.c: renamed babl_format_get_num_of_components()
	to babl_format_get_n_components().
	(babl_format_has_alpha): changed accordingly.

2009-01-24  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Do a complete overhaul of the babl API.

	* babl/babl.h: Instead of including subsystem headers, declare the
	functions part of the API directly in the header. The public
	types, macros and the version header is still pulled in as
	includes but with inclusion guards that prevent them from being
	included separately by clients. Notable things removed from the
	API is internal class functions and the class instance structs.

	(babl_format_has_alpha)
	(babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel)
	(babl_format_get_num_of_components)
	(babl_format_get_type): New getters to allow the Babl union to
	become opaque for clients.

	* babl/babl-types.h: New file with public types. Currently only
	the opaque Babl union and the linear and planar conversion
	function prototypes (which are not used in the API due to the use
	of varags but still part of the API for reference) are there. Make
	sure it's only included indirectly through babl.h.

	* babl/babl-macros.h
	* babl/babl-version.h.in: Make sure these are not included
	directly, only indirectly through babl.h.

	* babl/babl-main.h: Removed, function declarations are in babl.h
	now.

	* babl/babl-internal.h: Include the headers we now consider
	internal, mostly the different class headers.

	* babl/babl-class.h: The "named class" function declarations are
	now in the public header so move them away from this internal
	header.

	* babl/babl-image.h
	* babl/babl-format.h
	* babl/babl-fish.h
	* babl/babl-extension.h

	* babl/babl-introspect.h
	* babl/babl-sampling.h
	* babl/babl-model.h
	* babl/babl-type.h: Adapt to above changes, move relevant things to babl.h

	* babl/base/formats.c
	* babl/base/model-gray.c
	* babl/base/model-rgb.c
	* babl/base/model-ycbcr.c
	* babl/base/type-float.c: Explicitly #include "babl-classes.h".

	* babl/babl-internal.c: s/babl_name/babl_get_name/

	* babl/babl-format.c
	(babl_format_has_alpha)
	(babl_format_get_bytes_per_pixel)
	(babl_format_get_num_of_components)
	(babl_format_get_type): Implement these.

	* babl/Makefile.am: Don't install the now internal headers and
	add, remove and install the other headers according to above
	changes.

2009-01-18  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Since babl_foo_from_id() will not be part of the public API we can
	revert to having the short variant babl_foo() instead of
	babl_foo_from_name().

	* babl/babl-db.h: Namespace the include guard.

2009-01-18  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Do a s/babl_destroy/babl_exit since 'destroy' is better paired
	with a 'create' and other libraries also use the 'init'/'exit'
	pair, including GEGL. Keep a define for babl_destroy unless
	BABL_DISABLE_DEPRECATED is defined.

2009-01-18  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl-classes.h: New file collecting the type constants,
	includes and the union for the babl classes. When adding a new
	class this is the only installed header file that requires
	modification.

	* babl/babl-class.h: Move the class type enums to the new file.

	* babl/babl.h: Include babl-classes.h instead of each class on its
	own, and move the Babl union to the new file.

	* babl/babl-image.h: removed trailing whitespace.

2009-01-17  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Add #define babl_foo babl_foo_from_name macros, that should fix
	most builds that broke due to the below refactoring.

2009-01-17  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/base/util.h: Put it here for now instead.

2009-01-17  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	Instead of having BABL_CLASS() plus variants and making the macros
	expand to different things depending on if they are used in a
	header or a .c file, have two versions: BABL_CLASS_DECLARE() and
	BABL_CLASS_IMPLEMENT(). This enables further refactorisation of
	the babl.h header.

	* babl/babl.h: Do the name changes and remove the unpleasant
	#undefs at the bottom.

	* babl/babl-internal.h: Do the name changes.

	* babl/babl-component.[ch]
	* babl/babl-conversion.[ch]
	* babl/babl-extension.[ch]

	here.

	* babl/Makefile.am: Add it.

2009-01-15  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h: Make BablClassType an int again, it doesn't make
	sense as an enum as the set of class types is not a natural
	predefined set.

2009-01-14  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h: Make BablClassType an enum instead of an unsigned
	int contaning enum values.

2009-01-14  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h: Use a lowercase 'a' in 0xbab100.

2009-01-14  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	down a bit to make them less eminent.

2009-01-14  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h
	* babl/babl-internal.h: Remove BABL_HARD_MAX_PATH_LENGTH from
	here, it's only for internal use.

	* babl/babl-fish-path.c: #define BABL_HARD_MAX_PATH_LENGTH locally
	here.

2009-01-14  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h (BABL_ALPHA_THRESHOLD): Instead of an arbitrary
	threshold, use one hundredth of the channel intensity resolution
	when using 16 bit integers i.e. 0.01 / (2^16 - 1).

2008-12-08  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl-internal.h (babl_assert): Don't just eek when an

	conversions that are worse than the current BABL_TOLERANCE instead of
	the earlier arbitrary 0.01.

2008-11-16  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl-fish-path.c: Use the default babl tolerance level if
	BABL_TOLERANCE is the empty string so that we don't get a
	tolerance level of 0.0 in that case.

2008-11-16  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* babl/babl.h: Add #define BABL_ALPHA_THRESHOLD which is the alpha
	threshold used in the reference implementation for
	un-pre-multiplication of color data.

	* babl/base/model-rgb.c
	* babl/base/model-gray.c
	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c: Use the define, a consistent alpha
	threshold improves accurucy of conversions.

2008-11-16  Martin Nordholts  <martinn@svn.gnome.org>

	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c (conv_rgbAF_sdl32)
	* babl/base/model-gray.c (premultiplied_to_non_premultiplied):
	Make un-pre-multiplication with close-to-zero alpha values result
	in complete black instead of a bit brigher than black.

2008-11-08  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c: (conv_rgbAF_lrgba8): use the lookup tables
	to speed up the conversion 8still error of 0.002677 though).

2008-11-06  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c: (conv_rgbAF_rgbaF),
	(conv_rgbAF_lrgba8): make all components 0.0 when alpha < 0.00001.

2008-11-04  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c: (conv_rgbAF_rgbaF),
	(conv_rgbAF_lrgba8), (init): added some more missing conversions.

2008-11-04  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* extensions/gegl-fixups.c: (conv_rgbaF_rgbAF), (init): added missing,
	needed conversion.

2008-10-01  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* COPYING.LESSER: renamed to ..

2008-07-09  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* babl/base/Makefile.am: `:='-style assignments are not portable

2008-07-04  Sven Neumann  <sven@gimp.org>

	* extensions/Makefile.am: also use AM_CPPFLAGS and CPPFLAGS for
	building sse-fixups.

2008-07-01  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

2008-04-08  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	Applied patch from Jan Heller that improves logic of go_fishing code
	in babl-fish.c. The current code searches list of all fishes while
	looking for suitable preexistent BABL_FISH_PATH instance. The new code
	only searches relevant part of database's hash table. Further, the
	current code searches for fish path every time such a babl fish is
	requested, even though the same fish path has been requested before
	and not found. The new code creates dummy BABL_FISH instance with
	appropriate source/destination formats and inserts it into the fish
	database to indicate that fish path has been searched for and not
	found.

	correct lookup table.

2008-01-20  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	Always use BablFishPath's for accepted conversions. The path
	construction code is the location of the regression test, an
	earlier (now unneeded) optimization allowed using the first
	and best conversion available. The (not in bugzilla afair) bug
	manifest by this depended on the order of .so's on the file system
	to manifest itself.

	* babl/babl-fish.c: (go_fishing): only accepts paths when we go
	fishing for existing conversions.
	(babl_fish): elaborated a comment about why we avoid shortcut
	conversions and only paths.

	* NEWS: updated.

	destination around in memcpy.

2007-11-13  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	up existing fish (should perhaps be moved to lists going from given
	formats, similar to how conversions are added there instead.) Made
	go_fishing accept BABL_FISH_REFERENCE when source and desintation
	formats are equal.
	  (babl_fish_process): removed most of the need for BablImage for
	  linear buffers, do a memcpy when source and destination formats
	  are equal (and we're a BABL_FISH_REFERENCE).
	* babl/babl-db.[ch]: moved the BablDb struct out into public to
	allow faster iteration through it.

2007-11-11  Ã˜yvind KolÃ¥s  <pippin@gimp.org>

	* babl/babl-format.c: (format_new): make .image_template NULL by

	available instead of creating our own BablImage from scratch.
	* babl/babl-memory.c: (babl_free): special case freeing of BablImage
	and BablFormat to do the extra juggling needed for the image_template
	cache.
